# 💕 Will You Be My Valentine?

A playfully sweet Valentine's Day invitation page with a cheeky twist! This simple HTML and JavaScript project creates an interactive card that makes it nearly impossible for your loved one to say "no" to being your Valentine.

## ✨ Features

- **Beautiful Pink-Themed Card** - A romantic card design with hearts and flowers in lovely pinkish colors
- **Animated Decorations** - Floating hearts and beating heart animations for that extra romantic touch
- **Interactive Buttons**:
  - **"Yes" Button** - A lush pink button that's always ready to be clicked
  - **"No" Button** - A plain white outlined button with a playful twist... it runs away when your cursor gets near! 
- **Celebration Animation** - When they finally click "Yes", enjoy a beautiful celebration with exploding hearts
- **Irritatingly Sweet** - The "No" button is practically unclickable, making it hilariously inevitable that they'll say yes!

## 🎯 The Twist

The "No" button isn't just a button - it's a playful escape artist! Whenever the cursor gets within 100 pixels of it, the button jumps to a random location on the screen. It's the perfect mix of romantic and cheeky, making the whole experience memorable and fun.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Simply open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Share the file or host it online
3. Send the link to your special someone
4. Watch them try (and hilariously fail) to click "No"
5. Celebrate when they inevitably click "Yes"! 🎉

## 💝 Perfect For

- Valentine's Day proposals
- Asking someone to be your Valentine
- A fun and romantic gesture
- Making your loved one smile (and maybe laugh a little)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and transitions)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies!)

## 📱 Responsive

Works on desktop browsers. Best experienced with a mouse cursor for the full "chase the No button" effect!
